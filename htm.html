        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>Selecting a dataset that focuses on wine quality is important for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Domain Relevance:</b> Wine is a widely consumed and valued product around the world. Its quality is
            subject to a
            variety of factors, such as grape type, region of production, winemaking process, among others. Therefore,
            working with a data set on wine quality allows addressing a real and relevant problem in the real world.
          </li>
          <li><b>Interdisciplinarity:</b> The analysis of wine quality involves both scientific and sensory aspects.
            This can
            include physicochemical variables such as pH, acidity, alcohol content, as well as sensory characteristics
            such as aroma, flavor and appearance. This multidisciplinary approach provides an opportunity to explore
            different machine learning techniques that can integrate data from various sources and modalities.</li>
          <li><b>Complexity of the problem:</b> Wine quality is a multifaceted and subjective concept, influenced by
            numerous
            factors. This provides an interesting challenge for machine learning algorithms, which can be trained to
            detect complex patterns in the data and predict wine quality based on multiple characteristics.</li>
          <li><b>Commercial applications:</b> Wine quality analysis has significant commercial applications in the wine
            industry. Wineries can use machine learning models to optimize their production processes, improve the
            quality of their products and adjust their marketing strategies based on consumer preferences.</li>
        </ul>

          <p><b>Elkin Santis Palencia</b></p>
          <p> I'm Elkin, I'm 20 years old, I'm in seventh semester of system engineering. During the course of the
            career
            I have demonstrated skills developing programs with python, from basic programs to develop web pages with
            different frameworks. I am very passionate about the field of artificial intelligence and I hope to continue
            learning much more and be a great programmer.
            A random fact about me is that my favorite movie is Interstellar. The realism of the science in Interstellar
            makes the movie a wonder to behold, as it makes me feel like I'm really seeing from the inside how our
            universe works
